# PalmTunes
PalmTunes is a fun computer vision project that lets you **control your keyboard using hand gestures** detected via webcam.

This project uses:
- **Python OpenCV** for video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking.
- **PyAutoGUI** to simulate keyboard presses.

##  Features

-  Counts how many fingers you are holding up.
-  Simulates different keyboard presses:
  - **1 finger** ➔ Right arrow key
  - **2 fingers** ➔ Left arrow key
  - **3 fingers** ➔ Up arrow key
  - **4 fingers** ➔ Down arrow key
  - **5 fingers** ➔ Space bar
-  Uses a small delay to avoid multiple triggers.

## Use Cases:

- Control a **media player** using simple hand gestures:
  - Move forward or backward in a video or playlist by raising 1 or 2 fingers.
  - Increase or decrease volume by raising 3 or 4 fingers.
  - Pause or start playback by raising all 5 fingers.
- Navigate slides in a presentation hands-free.
- Build as a fun demo to learn computer vision and gesture recognition.
